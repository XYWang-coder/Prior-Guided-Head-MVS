![](images/teaser.png)

This repository includes some reconstruction results of our IEEE TMM 2021 paper, [Prior-Guided Multi-View 3D Head Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04277).

Authors: Xueying Wang, Yudong Guo, Zhongqi Yang and [Juyong Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~juyong/).

Note that all of the results are protected under patent. It can be only used for research purposes. If you are interested in business purposes/for-profit use, please contact Juyong Zhang (the corresponding author, email: juyong@ustc.edu.cn).

## Dataset
We applied our multiview head reconstruction method to 2D images from the [3DFAW-video repository](https://3dfaw.github.io/). We reconstructed 3D head models from around 30 high-resolution multi-view images of each subject.
